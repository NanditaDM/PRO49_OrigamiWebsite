        <h2>About the Task</h2>
        <p>This project was made by Nandita Mahyavanshi, as homework to WhiteHat Junior's course. WhiteHat Junior is a platform for kids to learn multiple forms of coding. A class is one hour long, and there can (now) be upto 5 classes in a week. This is project number 49, after class 49, which was our first mudule two class. During the class, we learnt about some basic HTML tags and how to call a CSS file in index.html. The task for the project was to create a website on Origami.</p>
